/**
 * Controls the internal state of the Contextual Search Manager.
 * <p>
 * This class keeps track of the current internal state of the {@code ContextualSearchManager} and
 * helps it to transition between states and return to the idle state when work has been
 * interrupted.
 * <p>
 * Usage: Call {@link #reset(StateChangeReason)} to reset to the {@code IDLE} state, which hides
 * the UI.<br>
 * Call {@link #enter(InternalState)} to enter a start-state (when a user gesture is recognized).
 * When doing some work on a state, which may be done in an asynchronous manner:<ol>
 * <li>call {@link #notifyStartingWorkOn(InternalState)} to note that work is starting on that state
 * <li>call {@link #notifyFinishedWorkOn(InternalState)} when work is completed.
 * <li>If a handler of an async response needs to do additional work, such as updating the UI, it
 * should first call {@link #isStillWorkingOn(InternalState)} to check that work has not been
 * interrupted since the async operation was started.
 * </ol><p>
 * The {@link #notifyFinishedWorkOn(InternalState)} method will automatically start a transition to
 * the appropriate next state.
 * <p>
 * Policy decisions about state transitions should only be done in the private
 * {@link #transitionTo(InternalState)} method of this class (not within the
 * {@code ContextualSearchManager} itself).

    // State-transition management.
    // This code is designed to solve several problems:
    // 1) Document the sequencing of handling a gesture in code.  Now there's a single method that
    //    determines the sequence that should be followed for Tap handling (our most complicated
    //    case.
    // 2) Document the initiation and subsequent notification/handling of operations.  Now the
    //    method that starts an operation and the notification handler are tied together by their
    //    references to the same state.  This allows a simple search to find the
    //    initiation and handler together (which is not always easy, e.g. SelectWordAroundCaret
    //    does not yet have an ACK so we infer that it's complete when the selection change -- or
    //    does not change after some short waiting period).
    // 3) Gracefully handle sequence interruptions.  When an asynchronous operation is in progress
    //    the user may start a new sequence or abort the current sequence.  Now the handler for an
    //    asynchronous operation can easily detect that it's no longer working on that operation
    //    and skip the normal completion of the operation.
