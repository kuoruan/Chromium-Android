/**
 * This class is for overriding factories of Modules in tests.
 *
 * The chosen approach for substituting dagger bindings in integrational tests is to override
 * Modules, without touching Components. Substituting the entire structure of Components in each
 * suite of tests is unreasonably cumbersome.
 *
 * Overriding the Modules themselves would not be a good enough solution in general,
 * because modules have parameters known only at creation time (such as parameters extracted from
 * Intent extras in an activity). Plus, in some tests there might be multiple instances of Modules
 * of the same type. Thus, instead of Modules we need to override factories of Modules.
 *
 * The factory overrides are set by tests as the first step of initialization. The production code
 * then calls {@link #getOverrideFor} to obtain the overridden factory, if any.
 *
 * Note that for unit tests you don't need to use this: create an instance of tested class directly
 * with "new", and pass the mocks.
